# Šumava NP — Forest Disturbance Detection

This repository contains an end-to-end analytical pipeline to detect and classify forest disturbances—primarily logging and bark beetle outbreaks—in the Šumava National Park, Czech Republic. The project integrates **Harmonic Regression Model** baselines generated via Google Earth Engine with advanced, tuned **Machine Learning Classifiers** implemented in Python (`scikit-learn`, `xgboost`). Leveraging multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, the pipeline aims to accurately map yearly disturbances by evaluating robust spatial and temporal features.

## Models

### 1 — Harmonic Regression Model
Built in Google Earth Engine, loosely based on the CCDC framework (Zhu & Woodcock, 2014).

### 2 — Machine Learning Models

Implemented in Python (`scikit-learn`, `xgboost`) for robust classification of forest disturbance. Features are evaluated across temporal and spatial dimensions.

## Machine Learning — Configuration

The ML pipeline evaluates spatial and time-series cross-validation strategies, applying hyperparameter tuning to find the optimum model configuration. It is heavily recommended to use the **optimium (tuned)** configuration over the default model options, as tuning adjusts the tree depth, learning rate, and estimator counts for maximum spatial generalizability.

### Optimum Hyperparameter Spaces

Models are optimized via Cross-Validated Grid Search to maximize F1-score across folds:

```python
# XGBoost Tuned Params Space
xgb_config = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [3, 6, 10],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2]
}

# Random Forest Tuned Params Space
rf_config = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10, 15],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 5, 10]
}
```

### Evaluation Strategy

- **Time-Series CV**: Trains on data from earlier years (e.g., 2016-2020) and validates on subsequent years to test temporal generalizability.
- **Spatial CV**: Uses `GroupKFold` on optimal spatial clusters (e.g., K=37 generated via `KMeans`) to ensure models generalize to completely unseen areas.

## Harmonic Regression — Configuration

All tunable parameters live in the `CONFIG` object at the top of the script:

```javascript
var CONFIG = {
  archiveStart:    '2020-01-01',   // Start of harmonic model training period
  archiveEnd:      '2024-01-01',   // End of training period (exclusive)
  detectStart:     '2024-01-01',   // Start of detection window
  detectEnd:       '2024-12-31',   // End of detection window
  seasonStart:     4,              // First month of growing season (April)
  seasonEnd:       11,             // Last month of growing season (November)
  numHarmonics:    2,              // 1 = annual only, 2 = annual + semi-annual
  zThreshResidual: -2.5,           // z-score threshold for flagging a scene
  minScenes:       2,              // Minimum alert scenes for persistence filter
  minPatchPx:      50,             // Minimum patch size in pixels (50 px = 0.5 ha)
  maxCloudPct:     50,             // Maximum cloud cover % for scene inclusion
  exportScale:     10,             // Export resolution in metres
  exportCRS:       'EPSG:32633',   // UTM Zone 33N
  exportFolder:    'GEE_Sumava',   // Google Drive output folder
};
```

## Outputs

### GEE Exports (Google Drive → `GEE_Sumava/`)

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `sumava_alerts_YYYY.tif` | Final disturbance alerts (all types), patch-filtered |
| `sumava_residual_z_YYYY.tif` | Minimum residual z-score across detection season |
| `sumava_scene_count_YYYY.tif` | Number of alert scenes per pixel |
| `sumava_first_day_YYYY.tif` | Day-of-year of first alert (days since Jan 1) |

All outputs are `Float32` GeoTIFFs in `EPSG:32633` at 10 m resolution.

> **Note:** Exports use `.selfMask()`, so masked pixels are written as `NoData` rather than `0`. Verify that your GIS software interprets `NoData` correctly before performing any area calculations.

## Known Issues & Limitations

**Slow bark beetle decline** — The abruptness filter (`firstAlertFraction < 0.6`) is intended to separate logging from gradual canopy dieback. Bark beetle outbreaks that begin early in the season may be misclassified as logging events.
